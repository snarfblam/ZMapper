<h2>Options</h2>
<h4>Input Always Enabled</h4>
<p>With this setting, hotkeys are always enabled and will always override all other applications as long as ZMapper is open.</p>
<h4>Enabled For Window Caption</h4>
<p>This setting will enable ZMapper hotkeys only for windows with specific captions. For example, if you use Mesen, you might want to use the pattern <code>Mesen*</code>. If you use multiple emulators, you can use a regular expression such as <code>Mesen|Nestopia|FCEUX</code>.</p>
<h4>Enabled For Window Class</h4>
<p>This option works the same as <em>Enabled For Window Caption</em>, except it is based on the <a href="https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winmsg/window-classes">window's class</a>.</p>
<h4>Always On Top</h4>
<p>This setting causes ZMapper to always remain in front of all other applications.</p>
<h4>No Focus On Click</h4>
<p>Enabling this option prevents ZMapper from stealing focus from other applications. This may be helpful if your emulator does something such as pausing or muting audio when it loses focus.</p>
