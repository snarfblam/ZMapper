<h3><a id="kb">Keyboard Input</a></h3>
<p>ZMapper uses global hotkeys for input. That means that while ZMapper input is active (the icon will show a red circle <img src="img://RedDot">), the keys that ZMapper uses will not work with any other applications. You can configure when ZMapper input is active via <a href="page://options">Options</a>.</p>
<p>Keyboard input is configurable. The default keyboard mapping is depicted, with functions described below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Directional</strong> - Move the cursor on the map, marking screens as visited. Used in conjunction with other keys as well.</li>
<li><strong>Bomb</strong> - Toggle bomb marker for bombable caves and dungeon walls. In dungeons, press this key followed by a directional to mark a wall which can not be bombed through.</li>
<li><strong>Candle</strong> - Toggle candle marker for burnable bushes.</li>
<li><strong>Recorder</strong> - Toggle the recorder marker for secrets revealed by the recorder.</li>
<li><strong>Screen connections</strong> - Press this key followed by a directional to toggle screen connections. Draw borders around screens in the overworld, and draw connections between rooms in dungeons.</li>
<li><strong>Point of Interest</strong> - Mark a screen as a point of interest. Press this key and then enter a 2-digit number corresponding to the desired POI marker.</li>

<li><strong>Undo</strong> - Undoes the last change made. This does not include marking screens as visited/unvisited.</li>

</ul>
<h4>Map</h4>
